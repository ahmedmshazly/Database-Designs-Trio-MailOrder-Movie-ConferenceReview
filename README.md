# Database Systems Project - MAIL ORDER, MOVIE, and CONFERENCE REVIEW Databases

## Overview
This repository contains our group project for the Database Systems course at [Your University Name]. Our project entailed designing three different databases: MAIL ORDER, MOVIE, and CONFERENCE REVIEW, each with its unique schema and requirements.

---

## MAIL ORDER Database
The MAIL ORDER database system was designed to manage orders for parts from customers. Key entities include employees, customers, items, and orders. Each entity and their relationships were meticulously modeled to ensure accurate representation of the business process.

### Key Features:
- Employee and customer data management.
- Item tracking with details like name, price, and stock quantity.
- Order processing and status tracking.

---

## MOVIE Database
The MOVIE database focuses on storing and managing data related to the movie industry. It includes entities such as movies, directors, actors, and production companies.

### Key Features:
- Movie information storage including title, year of release, and genre.
- Actor and director profiles and their associations with movies.
- Management of production company details.

## CONFERENCE REVIEW Database
This database was created to handle the submission and review process of research papers for a conference. It includes entities like papers, authors, reviewers, and conference sessions.

### Key Features:
- Tracking of paper submissions and their authors.
- Reviewer assignment and review management.
- Conference session scheduling and paper allocation.

## Project Structure
- **ER Diagrams**: Entity-Relationship diagrams for each database model.
- **SQL Scripts**: Scripts for creating and populating the databases.
- **PDF Documentation**: A comprehensive document detailing the design and implementation of each database.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: For database design and implementation.
- **Data Modeling Tools**: Used for ER diagram creation (e.g., Diagrams.net, Rational Rose).

---

## Repository Contents
- `ER_Diagrams`: Folder containing ER diagrams for each database.
- `SQL_Scripts`: Folder with SQL scripts.
- `Documentation.pdf`: A detailed document of the project.

---

## Future Work
- Refinement of database schemas based on user feedback and new requirements.
- Development of a front-end interface for each database system for easier interaction.
